# JeevaSankalp AI – System Architecture

---

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

JeevaSankalp AI follows a cloud-native, modular, and memory-centric architecture where ecological data is treated as a continuously evolving knowledge fabric rather than static records.

The architecture is designed to:

- Support Living Ecological Memory  
- Enable AI-driven memory evolution  
- Operate under low-bandwidth rural conditions  
- Scale to millions of land parcels
