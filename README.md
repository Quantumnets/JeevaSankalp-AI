# JeevaSankalp-AI
JeevaSankalp AI is a novel AI-driven platform that introduces the concept of Living Ecological Memory — enabling land parcels, soil, and rural ecosystems to retain, evolve, and act upon their historical biological and environmental experiences.

Unlike conventional smart agriculture systems that rely only on real-time prediction, JeevaSankalp AI treats land as a living entity with an evolving digital memory. By fusing sensor data, satellite imagery, mobile vision, and temporal AI models, the system builds Memory Evolution Networks (MEN) that continuously learn how ecosystems respond to human and natural interventions.

The platform generates multi-year regenerative pathways, detects early ecological degradation, and supports sustainable rural decision-making through multilingual voice and mobile interfaces. Built using AWS cloud-native services, JeevaSankalp AI aims to enable climate-resilient agriculture, soil regeneration, and long-term ecological sustainability for Bharat.
